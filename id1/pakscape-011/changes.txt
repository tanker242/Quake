v0.11, July 25 2000
--------------------
* Daikatana pak support.
* Starsiege vol support (uncompressed).
* Context menus.
* Somewhat improved progress indicator.
* Don't force lowercase names.
* Only recompress file if previous compression level is lower than 
  user's choice.
* Separate pk3 and zip compression choices.
* Drag archives to workspace area to open them.
* File size column is now always updated when overwriting a file.
* Fixed bug creating tree from zip file with weird directory 
  structure.
* Fixed bug when moving directories from a list view.
* Fixed crash bug when saving an archive fails.
* Fixed memory leak when saving pk3/zip files.
* Don't check if file is already viewed when you want to view it 
  again.
* Order of files within directories is now preserved. Previously the 
  order was reversed on load due to my not using doubly-linked lists. 
  Sometimes the order of files within the directory structure is 
  vital for the function of the file. Also, files you add to a 
  directory will be added last rather than first.
