PakScape is a PAK/PK3/VOL explorer/creator. Since PK3 files are really 
ZIP files it can also be used as a ZIP explorer/creator.

The PAK file formats supported are the formats used by games based on 
the Quake and Quake2 engines, including (but not limited to) Quake, 
Quake2, Half-Life, Soldier of Fortune and Daikatana.

The VOL file format supported is the format used by the Starsiege and 
Starsiege Tribes games- and only the uncompressed kind.


Features
--------
* Multiple Document Interface
* Explorer-like UI
* Drag & drop (including to and from Explorer)
* Import/export files and directories


Bugs/Limitations
----------------
* When moving objects (files and directories) all of the original 
  objects will be deleted unless you cancel the operation in a 
  'Confirm Replace' dialog. Answering 'No' will only result in that 
  the destination file is not overwritten- the file to be moved will 
  still be deleted!
* File type descriptions may be wrong for non-registered types unless 
  you have used the file open/save dialog. I have no idea why.
* If you decide to view a document (i.e. either double-click the document 
  or choose 'Open' from the context menu) that is registered to open with 
  PakScape the temporary file created will not be deleted when PakScape 
  closes.


Technical Information
---------------------
Maximum files in a PAK file: 4096
Maximum path in a PAK file:  55 bytes

Maximum files in a PK3 file: 65535
Maximum path in a PK3 file:  65535 bytes


Recommended System
------------------
* 686 300MHz
* 32MB free memory

Minimum System
--------------
* 586 200MHz
* 8MB free memory


Tips and Tricks
---------------
If you don't have a lot of free memory save the archive directly after 
you've added a few files.

If you don't have a fast processor use normal compression when saving 
zip/pk3 archives. Maximum compression is a lot slower and normally 
doesn't compress a whole lot more than normal compression.


To Do
-----
* Re-write the entire application... ON ICE.
* Cancel button for long archive operations
* Support for more file formats
* Help file
* Installer
