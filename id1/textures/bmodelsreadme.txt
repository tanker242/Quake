FAQ:
	Q1) How do I install these files?
	Q2) I have a suggestion/complaint/request or want to help... how can I?
	Q3) Why are the textures now TGA instead of PNG?



	A1) Remember, you need the original Quake 1 model files installed with these. CUSTOM MODELS WILL NOT WORK. After making sure you have the correct models installed, pick the engine you're using and follow the instructions:

	FuhQuake: extract the files to quake\id1\textures\bmodels

	FTEQuake: extract the files to quake\id1\textures

	DarkPlaces: extract the files to quake\id1\textures\progs    &&& you must rename the files to model.mdl_0.tga (so for example, armor_0.tga would need to be renamed to armor.mdl_0.tga ... the .mdl must be)


Just one note. I'd like to point out that switching between any two engines (I'm sorry if your engine is not shown here, e-mail me with info if I missed you) requires users to either move the files to another folder or move AND rename the files to another folder. This is a serious turnoff for the end-user and I urge engine coders to please come to a compromise in the naming system they use.



	A2) For any questions, comments, suggestions, complaints, or if you want to get involved in the project, contact me anyway you want (read below) :)



	Q3) The Quake Revitalization Project has for some time announced the move to TGA and from this point on (actually, from the dm6 releases on) all releases will be TGA. This is due to many reasons (file size, easier on the engine, etc) that is explained in full on the webpage's FAQ.
